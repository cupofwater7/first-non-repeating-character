# first-non-repeating-character

Difficulty: easy

  Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters
  and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.
  The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that
  occurs only once. If the input string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function
  should return -1.
